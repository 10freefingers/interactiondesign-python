a) The performance of which type of user can be predicted by KLM, according to Card et al.?
Card et al. stated that the KLM can be predicted for expert users who are familiar with the system. 
Expert users can choose between one or more methods to solve tasks out of which they choose the fastest. [1]

b) Which Fitts’ Law formulation is used by Card et al.?
Card et al. use this formulation of Fitts’s law:
p = .8 + .1 log2 (d/s + .5) sec
This variation of Fitts’s law was introduced by Welford. [2]

c) Why might the original KLM not perfectly model input performance on a laptop? How could it be adapted?
On a laptop there is the possiblity to use the touchpad instead of a mouse. In most cases this should be reached faster than a mouse, eventually even without having
to move the wrists. 
In this case the operator H (home hands to keyboard or mouse) should be ignored or there should be used an additional operator with an appropriate estimated time.
